<h2>About the game</h2>
<p>MinecraftGRPF is developed by Gamerappa, it's been under developement since November 22nd, 2020.

</p><h2>Origins</h2> 
<p>I have played Minecraft since about 2013.<br>
In late-November 2020, I came up with the (possibly unoriginal) idea of modding Minecraft Classic 0.0.13a_dev.<br>
</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>The developement has been a bit slow, The only changes between Minecraft 0.0.13a_dev and MinecraftGRPF 0.1.0b_01 is reimplemented terrain gen (13a_dev's tergen was flat),
added a small number of blocks (3 of which were requested by people I shortly moved on from, so those blocks were cut), and some other miscellanous stuff.<br><br>
I plan on backporting a bunch of features from Minecraft 0.0.14a_x, including the sky, fog, tergen, etc.</p>

</p><h2>The future</h2>
<p>I plan on developing MinecraftGRPF until it's complete, with a proper launcher not dependent on Minecraft's Launcher.
</p><p>For as long as people enjoy GRPF, I will still develop GRPF after the game is considered
done in my eyes.
